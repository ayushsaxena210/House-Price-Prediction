# Advanced Regression Assignment - House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, is planning to enter the Australian housing market. To make informed decisions about property investments, the company has collected a dataset containing information on house sales in Australia. The primary goal of this project is to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties. This model will help Surprise Housing assess the potential profitability of investing in these properties.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is provided in a CSV file, which contains various independent variables related to houses in Australia, including features like size, location, and other relevant attributes. The target variable is the price of the houses.

## Objectives

Surprise Housing aims to achieve the following objectives through this project:

1. Identify Significant Variables: Determine which independent variables are significant in predicting the price of a house in the Australian market.

2. Model Performance: Assess how well the selected variables describe the price of a house.

3. Regularization: Implement ridge and lasso regression to find the optimal values of lambda (penalty parameter) for each regularization technique.

## Business Goal

The business goals of this project are as follows:

- Build a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on available independent variables.
- Enable management to understand how house prices vary with different variables.
- Provide insights for the company to formulate a successful market entry strategy and focus on areas that promise high returns.
- Enhance management's understanding of pricing dynamics in the Australian housing market.
